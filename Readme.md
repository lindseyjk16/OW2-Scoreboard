# OW2Scoreboard

Customizable win/loss overlay for Overwatch 2™ streams.

# Original Project

This is a fork of [OwScoreBoard by HIJIKIsw](https://github.com/HIJIKIsw/OwScoreBoard), updated for Overwatch 2™ and its new competitive ranking system.

**NOTE:** The original project also provided a Japanese localization but support for non-English languages is currently suspended.
